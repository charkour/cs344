a) I would rather use Keras to build my model because it provides a more intuitive and simple API for creating
neural network models. I like how you define layers in Keras better than in TensorFlow. Perhaps I would like
TensorFlow if I had more experience with neural networks.

b)
best hyperparameters:
    learning_rate=0.001,
    steps=3000,
    batch_size=100,
    hidden_units=[10, 10],

Final RMSE (on training data):   106.13
Final RMSE (on validation data): 105.63
Final RMSE (on test data): 105.01

Performed the best on the test data!
