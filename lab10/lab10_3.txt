a) In this example, the confusion matrix shows which numbers (classes) were misclassified as other numbers.
8s and 5s and 4s and 9s sometimes get confused for each other.

b) The TensorFlow architecture is not a CNN like the Keras class example is meaning that the TensorFlow
architecture does not contain a convolution layer to capture local information and reduce the
complexity of the model. The TensorFlow architecture has two hidden layers that
is 100 nodes wide but the Keras one only has one hidden later that is 64 nodes wide.
If you are referring the the Keras network from unit 8, then the TensorFlow architecture has two hidden layers that
is 100 nodes wide but the Keras one only has one hidden later that is 512 nodes wide.

I could not increase the baseline accuracy. But I did increase the validation accuracy interestingly.
    learning_rate=0.05,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=100,
    hidden_units=[100, 100],
Final accuracy (on validation data): 0.95
Accuracy on test data: 0.95

baseline:
    Final accuracy (on validation data): 0.94
    Accuracy on test data: 0.95

c)
The 10 step visualizations were very pixelated and no patters in the images are evident. But in the 1000
step visualizations, more patterns of components of numbers start to appear. The images seem much more "smooth"
than the 10 step images.
