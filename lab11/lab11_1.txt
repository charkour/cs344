Exercise 11.1
a) Linear models are better than a deep NN model when the data being modeled has a strong linear relationship,
thus a linear model will provide a simpler model than the deep NN model as well as use much less computing
power to calculate a model than training a NN to model a linear relationship. Linear models will train
more quickly than DNNs.

b) NN does better than linear model.
NN test acc: 0.84
Linear test acc: 0.7846

c) Embeddings do not perform as well as the NN model from task 2.
NN test acc: 0.84
W/ embeddings: 0.7798


d) poor and dull have very similar embeddings. This makes sense because they are both words that
are from negative reviews. These words aren't very strong or forceful, but they still get
the negative point across. The carry the same "impact" or "weight" when you say them aloud, so
people use them in similar contexts when writing reviews.

e)
my_optimizer = tf.train.AdagradOptimizer(learning_rate=0.2)
my_optimizer = tf.contrib.estimator.clip_gradients_by_norm(my_optimizer, 5.0)
classifier = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(
  feature_columns=feature_columns,
  hidden_units=[10,10],
  optimizer=my_optimizer
)
I used all the terms and 1000 steps.

training accuracy 0.85612
test accuracy 0.8394
