Exercise 11.2

a) There are some outliers in the data which might skew the data; for example, hours_per_week has a minimum of one
and an apparent max of 99 which is a little strange.
There are many zeros in capital_gains and capital_loss which makes sense, but it is still something to note
that could skew the data. Additionally, there are about 2/3 males and 1/3 female in the dataset
which would normally each
be 1/2 which could show male bias and skew the dataset.

b) There could be bias in the dataset related to the male to female ratio for civilly married couples.
When looking at the male:female ratio for marital status, females are significantly underrepresented in the
Married-civ-spouse category by 1:5, but in the other categories of marital status, the ratio is roughly 1:1.
Having married women underrepresented could be a potential bias in the data.

c) Trained a model with 0.83379817 test accuracy.

d) When looking at race, the Black subgroup has a comparable precision to the other subgroups
(0.6202 with other being around 0.77+),
but has a relatively low recall compared to the others (0.4762 with the others usually around 0.52+).
There are more false negatives than true positives
in the Black subgroup which could mean that the model struggles with correctly identifying Blacks over 50K.
The data is skewed towards Blacks <50K shown by the large True Negative number.
A similar issue is noticed with the Other subgroup.
