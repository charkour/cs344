1. We want the ML model to predict if an email in Gmail is "important".
2. Our ideal outcome is to flag emails as important that are imperative the to user, increasing the user experience
and insuring they do not miss an important email.
3a. Our success metric would be users seeing all of their important emails.
3b. We want 95% of important emails to be properly flagged as so.
3c. Failure would be if the user misses emails they should see.
4. Classification output. If an email is important or not.
5a. The output will be a boolean value for each incoming email as to if the email is true or false.
5b. The output will immediately be shown to the user in the UI.
6. One possible heuristic would be to flag emails as important if it from a sender that the user
usually responds to and spends a long time reading the email. Another heuristic could be if an email
contains specific keywords or is in reply to a ongoing conversation between the user and another.
7a. Our problem is best framed as a binary classification, which predicts if an email is flagged as important or not.
7b. Binary classification. Each email is either either important or not based on features such as
date, time, sender, contents, subject.

Date    | Time      | Sender        | Contents          | Subject       | Output (Label)
03/20/20 6:00am     jon@calvin.edu   Hi Charlie....      Turtle Tracker  Important
03/20/20 3:59am     spam@email.com   HELLO.I am PRINCE   Send my GOLD    Unimportant

9. Date, Time, Sender, Contents, Subject all come from the metadata of the email.
I will not be too hard to parse the email for this data and pipeline it into a .csv.
10. Sender        | Contents                | Subject
