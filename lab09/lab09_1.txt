a. How effective is the linear regression approach to the problem?
Linear regression approach does not do too well, shown by how the training doe .01 better than the validation.
There is some inconsistency in the RMSE as the periods increase showing that the model might not fit the data too well.
Linear regression uses L2 Loss which does not account for "confidence errors" in the classifications meaning the
accuracy of the model is not calculated as well as it should be when training.

b. Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.
L2 Loss and LogLoss are both evaluation metrics for false classifications to assess the accuracy of a classifier.
They contrast in the way the loss functions penalize for misclassifications. L2 does not not take into account
the amount the probability is off of 0 or 1, but LogLoss penalizes "confidence errors" in the probability more heavily.

c. Task 2: Explain how effective logistic regression is compared with linear regression.
In this case, the LogLoss vs periods graph is smoother than the graph for linear regression
showing that the logistic regression model fits the data better than the linear regression.
To find how much better, we would next to calculate the LogLoss for the linear regression.
The validation data does better than the training data with the logistic regression, opposite from what the linear
regression graph shows. This means the logistic model fits the data better then the linear model.

d. Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to get them.
Best:
AUC on the validation set: 0.78
Accuracy on the validation set: 0.78

With hyperparameters:
    learning_rate=0.000004,
    steps=2000,
    batch_size=100,
