a)

1) cities["Saint50SqMi"] = (cities["City name"].apply(lambda name: name.startswith("San"))) & (cities["Area square miles"] > 50)

b)
Pandas provides an API useful for data manipulation

c) When the data is sorted, it is helpful to reorder it when splitting into testing and trainig sets
in order to make sure there is no correlation between the data.
