Pandas provides an API useful for data manipulation and analysis such as the DataFrame object.
NumPy allows users to work with high-performance, multi-dimensional arrays.

c)
When the data is sorted, it is helpful to reorder it when splitting into testing and training sets
in order to make sure there is no correlation between each observation and that the test
and training sets are good representations of the whole data set.
