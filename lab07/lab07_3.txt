california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (
   california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] / california_housing_dataframe["population"])

calibration_data = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.03,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    input_feature="rooms_per_person"
)

Final RMSE (on training data): 134.65

a.2)
plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])

There are quite a few (7) outliers where the predicted value is above 1500. Looking at the data, the average value
of rooms_per_person is 2, but the max value is 55.2, which is one of the seven outliers. I assume that the
rest of the outliers are also called by very large rooms_per_person values.

a.3)
california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (
    california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"]).apply(lambda x: min(x, 7))

california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].hist()

calibration_data = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.05,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    input_feature="rooms_per_person")

Final RMSE (on training data): 110.85 (better than in task2)

b) Synthetic features extended the ability to make predictions from data by calculating data that
was not originally collected by combining features.

c) An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the rest of the data. They are typically
removed from the feature before training a model.
