a)
Both categorical and numeric data can have numbers. Categorical data is text based and can be thought of as
a classifier or label (ie. man, woman are classifiers). Numerical data is a number that can be an int or float.
Numerical operations can be formed on numeric data.

b.Task1)
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00003,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=1
)

Final RMSE (on training data): 167.71

b.Task2)
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00003,
    steps=300,
    batch_size=5,
    input_feature="population"
)

Final RMSE (on training data): 192.75 (tried but wasn't better)

c)
The hyperparameters are learning_rate, steps, and batch_size. (input_feature sets the feature in the model).
There is not a standard tuning algorithm for tweaking the hyperparameters, but there are rules of thumb to follow
which are provided on the TensorFlow tutorial page. I would not it a standard algorithm because tweaking the
hyperparamters has a different effect for each set of data, and I feel a standard algorithm would want
the same results for each dataset.
